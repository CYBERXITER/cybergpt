Scene 3: At school, the shirt gives Max the courage to stand up to bullies, not by fighting but by saying exactly the right words to defuse the situation.

Scene 4: Max discovers that wearing the shirt on Tuesday makes him incredibly fast, and on Thursdays, it lets him remember everything he reads.

Scene 5: After using the shirt to ace a test, Max feels guilty and confesses to his teacher about his magical advantage.

Scene 6: His teacher smiles knowingly and reveals that the true magic wasn't in the shirt but in Max himself â€“ the shirt just helped him believe in his own abilities.

Scene 7: Max still wears the shirt sometimes, but now he knows the real magic comes from within himself.`;
